            Imagine you have a dashboard where different users require different
            navigation structures. This menu system allows each user to rearrange
            and display only the sections they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try enabling edit mode, then drag the menu items to reorder them.
            When you exit edit mode, the order is saved and restored automatically
            on your next visit.
          </p>
        </section>;
