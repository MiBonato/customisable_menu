              This application demonstrates a React-based menu system that can be
              rearranged according to user preferences. You can drag and drop menu
              items (when edit mode is enabled) and navigate between different pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use the top menu to explore the various sections and see how the layout
              adapts based on your access rights.
            </p>
